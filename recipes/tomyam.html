        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>This homemade hot and sour soup (tom yum) is easier than most recipes you will find. I have simplified a sometimes complex recipe for those like me who can have a hard time finding some of the original ingredients. This is my favorite recipe, better than any tom yum in the many restaurants I have been to. </p>
